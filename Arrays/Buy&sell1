You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


Solution:
In this we can take first element as the minimum and then check if array has element subtracting minimum and element gives maximum

mini=arr[0]
maxi=0
for i in range(len(arr)):
    k=arr[i]-mini
    maxi=max(maxi,k)
    mini=min(mini,arr[i])
return maxi
